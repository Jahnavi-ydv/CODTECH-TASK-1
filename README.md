**Project Overview: Basic Calculator in Python**
**Purpose**:
The purpose of this project is to create a simple command-line calculator program in Python. The program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers of their choice.

**Key Components**:
Functions for Arithmetic Operations:

add(x, y): Adds two numbers x and y.
subtract(x, y): Subtracts y from x.
multiply(x, y): Multiplies x by y.
divide(x, y): Divides x by y. Includes error handling for division by zero.
Menu and User Input Handling:

The program starts with a welcome message and presents a menu using a while True loop, which allows repeated operations until the user chooses to exit.
Users are prompted to select an operation by entering a number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).
Execution of Operations:

Depending on the user's choice, the corresponding arithmetic function is called with the user-input numbers.
The result of the operation is displayed to the user.

**Error Handling**:

The program checks for division by zero in the divide function and displays an appropriate error message if the user attempts division by zero.
Exiting the Program:

Users can choose to exit the program by selecting option 5 from the menu. This breaks the loop and ends the program.
**Features**:
User-Friendly Interface: The program provides a clear and structured menu for selecting operations.
Basic Arithmetic: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Error Handling: Specifically handles division by zero to prevent runtime errors.
Looping Structure: Uses a while True loop to continuously prompt the user until they choose to exit.

**output**:
